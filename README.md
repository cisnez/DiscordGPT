## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your bot by creating a `be_whatever.yaml` file based on the `bot_config.yaml` template.
4. Create file config/keys.py with your OpenAi API Key
5. Create file config/tokens.py with your Discord Developer-Application-Bot-Token
6. Run the bot using `python main.py`.

## Note about Discord's `Bot` class.
Here are the built-in properties and attributes specifically for`discord.ext.commands.Bot`:

`command_prefix`: A string, a list of strings, or a callable that returns a string or list of strings. It defines the prefix(es) for the bot's commands. For example, if the command prefix is "!", users can invoke a command called hello by sending a message like !hello.

`description`: A string that provides a short description of the bot. It's displayed in the default help command provided by the bot.

`pm_help`: A boolean that indicates whether the help command should be sent as a private message when called in a server channel. Default is False.

`help_attrs`: A dictionary of attributes used to customize the default help command.

`help_command`: An instance of the HelpCommand class or its subclass that defines the bot's help command. You can set it to None to remove the help command.

`case_insensitive`: A boolean that indicates whether the bot should ignore the casing of command names and prefixes. Default is False.

`self_bot`: A boolean that indicates whether the bot should only listen to commands invoked by itself. Default is False.

`_BotBase__cogs`: An internal attribute that holds a dictionary of the bot's cogs.

`_BotBase__extensions`: An internal attribute that holds a dictionary of the bot's extensions.

`_BotBase__application_id`: An internal attribute that stores the bot's application ID.

`_BotBase__owner_id`: An internal attribute that stores the bot's owner ID.

`_BotBase__owner_ids`: An internal attribute that stores a set of the bot's owner IDs, if applicable.

These properties are specific to the `discord.ext.commands.Bot` class. However, since it's a subclass of `discord.Client`, it also inherits properties from that class. You can find the complete list of `discord.Client` properties in the official documentation:

`discord.Client`
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Client

Combining these properties allows you to create highly customizable Discord bots that can cater to your specific needs. ðŸ’…

## Note about OpenAi's `API`.
Here's a summary of the method hierarchy of the OpenAI Python library:

1. `openai.api.Completion`: This is the main class that provides access to the OpenAI API. It has a method called `openai.api.Completion.create()` that can be used to generate text completions.

2. `openai.api.Completion.create()`: This method takes in a model parameter that specifies the name of the model to use for text generation. It also takes in a prompt parameter that contains the text prompt to generate completions for. The method returns a `CompletionResult` *object* that contains the generated completions.

3. `openai.api.CompletionResult`: This class contains the generated completions and other metadata about the completion request. It has a choices attribute that contains a list of `CompletionChoice` *objects*.

4. `openai.api.CompletionChoice`: This class represents a single completion choice generated by the API. It has attributes such as text (the generated text), index (the index of the choice), and confidence (the confidence score of the choice).

In addition to the Completion class, the OpenAI Python library also provides other classes and methods for accessing different parts of the OpenAI API, such as openai.api.Engine, openai.api.File, and openai.api.Organization. These classes and methods provide access to other features of the OpenAI API, such as fine-tuning models, uploading files, and managing organizations.
